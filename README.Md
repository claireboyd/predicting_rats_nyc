## Time-Series Forecasting with Prophet

This repository is for a hands-on presentation focused on using prophet for time series analysis. It covers:
- a **high-level overview of time series analysis**
- an **illustration of Facebook's python** package called prophet by using AirPassengers data, modeling the number of passengers flying to Austrailia in the 1960s.
- an **application of prophet in the public sector** (predicting rat activity in NYC neighborhoods)

For more information about this work and a step-by-step guide, see the ipynb file [prophet_session.ipynb](/prophet_session.ipynb). Thanks!
